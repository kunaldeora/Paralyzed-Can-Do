# Paralyzed-Can-Do

Developed a database application for paralyzed people suffering from AD (Autonomic Dysreflexia), 
specifically alleviating the potentially life threatening situations by giving them control over their urinary bladder system using a device. 

Main challenges were to fetch the appropriate brain signals from the neurons and interpret them, mapping those signals to their corresponding organ, giving user the control over his bladder using a device. Constructed stored procedures on triggers, which implemented functions to convert neuron frequency to binary and cursors to populate tables simultaneously. 

Indexes were implemented to speed up the retrieval process. 


Designed a Spring MVC application deployed on a web server(Apache Tomcat). Provide a database connectivity with MySQL, acting as an interface for the user, taking in the userâ€™s action. 

Continuous flow of dynamic data was ensured using triggers. Datatbase Views and backup tables were implemented.
